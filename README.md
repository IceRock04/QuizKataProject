# QuizKataProject
This repository is for the implementation and creation of a Quiz Application. It will utilize the Open Trivia Database as the source of the program's quiz questions.

This quiz application will utilize numerous coding practices such as the MVC, which is used to separate key components in the program's structure to improve code organization. It will also use the Strategy Pattern throughout the program to reduce control coupling between modules and functions within the application.
